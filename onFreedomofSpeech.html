			<h1>On Freedom of Speech</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="Paragraph">
			<p>"<em>If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear</em>" - George Orwell</p>
			<p>This is, as I see it, one of the most important truths ever spoken. Why is it then, that more and more it seems that this moral imperative, freedom of speech, seems to be shunned? Some would claim that the defence of free-speech is a far-right dog whistle, but this is not my intention, nor is it my understanding. I was unaware, first of all, that freedom of speech was a right-wing idea. By that logic, we may describe the human rights commission as a far-right organisation. No, the truth is not that the right has claimed free-speech; but that the left has rejected it. As a classical liberal, I find this disturbing for a myriad of reasons; reasons which I shall hope to vividly portray in the remainder of this essay.</p>
			<p>First however, It is prudent to define the terms we are working with. Classical liberalism is a philosophy and ideology based around the inherent rights of man, free-market capitalism, and small government. Authoritarianism is a system of government characterised by strong, central control; which it uses to impose its own power regardless of human rights. It is often colloquially described as fascism. Finally, freedom of speech is the right of all human beings to make their opinions known and say whatever they please; as long as it does not directly incite violence.</p>
			<p>Before I begin my defence of free speech, it is necessary to show that there is indeed a problem. I think the following example, an example I am sure you have heard about. On April 28th 2016, Markus Meechan, better known by his online moniker 'Count Dankula', was arrested for producing a short video of his dog performing a Nazi salute and reacting to phrases commonly used by anti-Semitic groups. Markus clearly signposted the context of the scenario and explained this was done as a joke to annoy his girlfriend, and yet he was dragged before the Scottish courts. During the course of his trial, the judge is reported to have said that the context of the case was irrelevant and that the court was allowed to ignore the context of the situation. To further abuse the clich√©, does that not sound truly Orwellian. Let us also note a similar case that happened in Nazi Germany in the 1940s when a Finnish man trained his dog to do the same. In that case, the German state didn't press charges, do we really wish to be stricter on free speech than actual fascists?</p>
			<p>On top of this we have the 'deplatforming' of several centrist, moderate left, and moderate right speakers. Including, but not limited to: Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Shapiro, Carl Benjamin, Katie Hopkins, Dr Jordan Peterson, Christina Hoff Summers, and many more. This is often done by groups of violent, far left thugs, who harass the universities which wish to platform these speakers and force the university to cancel the event. And while it is true that no one has a right to a platform, once somebody has been given a platform you do not have the right to hassle the creators of the platform into silencing them. In these examples, any reasonable person could see the problem.</p>
			<p>I believe freedom of speech to be a critical social mechanism; as was seen In the autumn of 2009, when Nick Griffin (founder and leader of the far-right British National Party [BNP]) appeared on the BBC program 'Question Time'. During this program, his shocking views were put on full display. In just two years, the BNP decreased in paid membership from 4220 to a meagre 500, why? Because the British public was made aware of the disgusting beliefs the party held. By giving this hateful organisation a platform, the British public were able to hold them to account. Sunlight, in this case, was the best disinfectant. Imagine if this were to not happen; if we did not hold fascists to account, and instead hid them away and removed their right to speak. If someone with despicable ideas is not allowed to speak them, they do not stop believing these ideas. They instead feel victimised and, without a legitimate means of expressing this, they become violent. Evil words or evil actions, which would you prefer?</p>
			<p>Critics may suggest, that by allowing such people a platform we risk members of the public acquiring their dangerous beliefs. I, however, have more faith in humanity than to suggest that the average person would take on morally detestable ideas just from hearing them. The greatest enemy of the fascist is mockery, as it denies them fear. Without public forum, we can not devalue their opinions and through this rhetorical neglect, we inadvertently give them credence. If the Nick Griffin case has taught us two things, it is that people can recognise bad ideas when they hear them, and that laughter is poison to authoritarians. I do not suggest we allow these people to speak unchallenged, on the contrary, I believe we should criticise them at every point. By publicly defeating these ideas we fuel the fire of ridicule and further devalue their monstrous assertions.</p>
			<p>What most concerns me, is that it is my fellow liberals condemning the position of free speech. By all reasonable definitions, disrupting free speech is a wholly illiberal proposition. Let us say for a moment that we do put into place restrictive speech laws, that is to say, we expand the already often abused laws; you have then given the state the capacity to suppress speech. You have handed the government power on a silver platter. Imagine then, that a far-right faction one day comes into power. They now have the legal ability to suppress you; and have no doubt, they will use it. In this, it is dangerous to increase the power of the state. Students of history can tell you where that path lead us in the 20th century, let us not go there again.</p>
			<p>One common counterpoint is that free-speech is not under attack, but rather 'Hate-Speech' is. However, hate-speech is a rather vague description and as such, has often been abused to shut down perfectly acceptable speech. Is criticising a major religion Hate-Speech? Many would say so, others wouldn't. That is the problem. If the definition is vague enough anything can be counted as hate-speech, the very fact that there is disagreement in the above matter is problematic. Vague laws are a tyrants plaything, and can easily be spun contrary to their original purpose.</p>
			<p>To add to this, the entire purpose of freedom of speech is to protect unpopular opinions. Defending free-speech isn't necessary for popular views. Nobody is going to suggest a citizen be arrested for saying that their local council is vaguely dysfunctional; it is in unpopular speech that the ideal of free-speech is needed. The Independence of the United States, the liberation of women, the rights of the LGBTQ+ community; these were all once unpopular views and, without freedom of speech, they would never have succeeded. Speakers for these groups achieved the futures they wanted to see. Without free-speech, we are left unable to.</p>
			<p>If we are only allowed to say what is popular and acceptable, then we can not hope to make the changes we wish to impose. The road to authoritarianism is paved with good intentions, so we must be vigilant. Trading away our liberty so easily is moral cowardice; we must face disgusting views forthrightly. Free-speech is the mechanism through which we will build the future we want to see, with our words we can set the world free.</p>
